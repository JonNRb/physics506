## EM Boundary Conditions - Lab Journal

### Agenda

 * Set up equipment / get familiar with equipment.
 * Take initial measurements.

## Setting up the PASCO initially

 * Looks like components are in the right order (on the line).
 * Checked magnetic stage so the white lines line up.
 * Aligned the laser using the screws.

 * Moved things on the rails focused the laser better.
   * Positions on rails LTR `[36.5cm, 14cm, 1m]`
   * Semicircle was in the way
   * Also, position of polarizer doesn't seem to matter much.
   * New positions of lens: `37.5cm`


 * OK, so there are dispersion losses: this doesn't really matter since the
   sample will always be present in all measurements **CHECK THIS LATER**

## Procedure Part 1: _Initial Observation_

### Eyeballed not-that-special angles

 * Reflection at `°`
 * Sample tilted so incident is `50°`
 * Transmitted at `∆`
