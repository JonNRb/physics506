- The *Half-Wave Plate* lets the incident beam pass through, but shifts its
  polarization vector by an angle. The angle can be adjusted by rotating the
  plate. We use this to adjust the beam incident to the *Beamsplitter* to
  adjust the amplitude ratio of the signal and reference beams (the signal
  attenuates on its path).

- The *AOM* is a device that has a medium whose index of refraction can be
  varied using an electrical signal. We use this to modulate the amplitude of
  the light beam.

- The *Cube Beamsplitter* is made of two triangular prisms the splits an
  incident beam into two beams with orthogonal polarizations.

- The *Time Interval Counter* measures signals on time intervals with 25ps
  accuracy. We need this to analyze our signals which will differ on a very
  small time scale.

The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. If the Earth moved through the aether
at 30 km/s, we would need to detect differences in the speed of light by
0.0001 c to demonstrate the existence of the aether.

Our electronic measurement tools are extremely accurate. The *Time Interval
Counter* measures on the picosecond scale, which is sufficiently accurate to
measure the amplitude shift in light bouncing off a ΔL of 1m. The largest
source of error will be our distance measurements. Assuming we can measure Δt
with perfect accuracy, if there was 4mm of total ΔL error we would be within
0.0001 c for a 40 m run. This is sufficiently accurate to detect the aether.
