Goal: remove noise and measure `c` with the oscilloscope

- Our mirrors must have been moved. We had to readjust them all over again and
  filter the AOM output again
- The detectors weren't ON. Turning them on removed the noise.
- Recalibrated half-wave plate to get equal amplitudes on the oscilloscope
  ~400 mV
- Measured out of phase frequency: 4.13 MHz
- Measured in phase frequency: 8.82 MHz
