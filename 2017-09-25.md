## EM Boundary Conditions - Lab Journal

### Agenda

- Set up equipment / get familiar with equipment.
- Take rest of measurements.

### General

- All angles measured are ±0.5°

## Procedure Part 1: _Initial Observation_

### Brewster's angle estimation

- Laser polarization: 160°

  - We eyeballed the maximum laser intensity when changing the polarization. This should be the polarization of the incident beam.
  - When set up with the polarizer, we can set the absolute polarization of the beam incident with the sample. We shouldn't be losing too much power using the polarizer.

- Plastic sample

Polarization Angle | Incident Angle | Reflected Angle | Reflected Power | Transmitted Angle | Transmitted Power
------------------ | -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | -----------------
90°                | 36°            | 76°             | 400 nW          | 16°               | 32 µW
0°                 | 36°            | 76°             | 31.8 µW         | 16°               | 465 µW

- Plastic sample

Polarization Angle | Incident Angle | Reflected Angle | Reflected Power | Transmitted Angle | Transmitted Power
------------------ | -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | -----------------
0°                 | 39°            | 77°             | 22.4 µW         | 16°               | 215 µW
90°                | 39°            | 77°             | 464 nW          | 16°               | 15.5 µW

### Critical angle estimation

- Plastic sample

  - 256 nW energy of transmitted beam (at 28°), 1.89 µW of reflected beam (86°)
  - (Polarization shouldn't change the ratio between reflected and transmitted energies)

## Procedure Part 2: _Snell's Law_

- We're collecting:

  - For each (sample, interface) pair,

    - Transmitted angle
    - Incident angle
    - Transmitted energy
    - Incident energy

- Glass to air interface (has measurement errors DO NOT USE)

  - 40° incident angle, 13.4 µW, 29° transmitted angle
  - 35° incident angle, 15.6 µW, 21° transmitted angle
  - 30° incident angle, 18.5 µW, 15° transmitted angle
  - 25° incident angle, 16.4 µW, 12° transmitted angle
  - 15° incident angle, 15.6 µW, 5° transmitted angle

- Air to glass interface

Incident Angle | Transmitted Power | Transmitted Angle
-------------- | ----------------- | -----------------
15°            | 22.5 µW           | 6°
25°            | ---- µW           | 10°
35°            | ---- µW           | 14°
40°            | ---- µW           | 16°
45°            | 21.5 µW           | 9°
