## EM Boundary Conditions - Lab Journal

### Agenda

- Take rest of measurements.

### General

- Had to replace batteries for FieldMaster power measuring device.

- Took new measurements for Snell's Law part. Our original measurements seemed to give bad predictions of `n_1 / n_2`; the ratios for each measurement were quite varied.

- Recalibrated the laser:

  - Laser at `1.0 cm` (did not move)
  - Lens at `27.2 cm`
  - Polarizer at `14.4 cm`
  - Polarizer set to `162°` (measured at little bottom nub thing)

## Procedure Part 2: _Snell's Law_

### Glass to air interface

Incident Angle | Transmitted Angle
-------------- | -----------------
28°            | 43°
22°            | 32°
20°            | 30°
25°            | 36°
15°            | 22°

### Plastic to air interface

Incident Angle | Transmitted Angle
-------------- | -----------------
15°            | 23°
20°            | 29°
21°            | 31°
30°            | 48°
25°            | 40°
