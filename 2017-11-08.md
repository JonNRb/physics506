## _The Speed of Light Lab_

Goal for today: get signal and reference beams on the oscilloscope

- Turned on laser system (AOM, laser, detectors) and focused beam
- Turned on function generator and set a 1Hz sine wave
- Filtered out 1st order beam with an index card at the half-wave plate
- Got parallel beam from beam splitter into the reference detector
- Got perpendicular beam from beam splitter to first mirror
- Moved mirrors to get the signal beam into its detector
- We're not seeing anything on the oscilloscope
- Moved frquency to MHz scale and now we see the reference beam
- Recalibrated half-wave plate and now we get two signals. They're really noisy.
