## The Zeeman Effect - Lab Journal

### Agenda

- Try doing Hysteresis curve

### General

What the hysteresis curve should look like:

### Part 1: _Establish a Hysteresis Curve_

We're taking a bunch of data points at 1 Ampere intervals to establish our Hysteresis curve. We are going to increase the current up to +8 Amperes then bring it down to 0 A, turn off the power, and repeat several times.

Data Point | Current | Field Strength
---------- | ------- | --------------
1          | 1 A     | 0.239 T
2          | 2 A     | 0.417 T
3          | 3 A     | 0.566 T
4          | 4 A     | 0.755 T
5          | 5 A     | 0.902 T
6          | 6 A     | 1.015 T
7          | 7 A     | 1.211 T
8          | 8 A     | 1.256 T
