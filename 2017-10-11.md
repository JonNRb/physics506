## The Zeeman Effect - Lab Journal

# General

- Was late. I missed:

  - Putting in the mercury tube
  - Other setup

- Set up polarizing filter to 114°

  - Phil says this may not be necessarily right
  - "All relative to the fiber optic feed going into the SPEX" Phil says
  - "You may have to adjust the angle if your data is lumpy" Phil says

## Part 2: _Equipment Setup_

Followed the instructions.

## Part 3: _No Magnetic Field_

Centered the Polaroid to 114°. Recorded the 404.7 nm line using a narrow sweep range. Data was garbage.

Opened the aperture. Ahh now we're cookin!
