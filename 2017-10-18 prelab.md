## 1

X-Rays are photons on the order of `0.01 nm` - `10 nm`. This is small enough to probe crystalline structures of materials. The X-rays are produced by a beam of electrons accelerated over 30 kV into a water-cooled copper target (inside the Rigaku Miniflex).

## 2

_Bremsstrahlung_ is used because there is a continuous distribution of wavelengths, which allows probing a distribution of wavelengths, unlike _K-shell_ emission, which is good for specific wavelengths.

## 3

Bragg's Law describes how incident photons reflect constructively at certain frequencies as they interact with the electron clouds of atoms on the surface of a crystal and the lower layers. Bragg's Law gives the condition of this scattering: twice the interplanar distance times the sine of the incident angle must be an integer multiple of the wavelength (`2d sin(a) = n lambda`).

Because our sample is powdered such that there are many differently oriented crystallites, the beam will be incident at many angles. This ensures there are some crystallites for which there will be Bragg scattering.

## 4

The Miller indices essentially give coordinates of diffraction plane relative to the standard orientation of crystalline structure. The inverse of the distance multiplied by the crystal size gives the correct spacing of the planes for Bragg scattering.

## 6

X-Rays interact with one another and interfere destructively.

## 7

As the sample is warmed, the crystal will expand (causing `a` to increase), causing the spectrum to contract.
